Usage:
    npm install
    node server.js

Then go to http://localhost:8080 (the port is hardcoded in `server.js` file).

Also, the project supplies some NodeJS demo testing files in `demo/`.
Each file is a script that can be easily launched using simple `node` command.
`demo/modules` contains the demo of how modules in NodeJS work.
Example:
    cd demo
    node streams.js
    cd modules
    node app.js
